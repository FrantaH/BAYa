# BAYa
projekt do předmětu Bayesovské modely pro strojové učení (v angličtině) 2021


In this assignment, your task will be to implement and analyze algorithms for inference in probabilistic models described by factor graphs. In particular, you will implement Sum-Product algorithm (or Belief Propagation), Max-Product (Max-Sum) algorithm and Loopy Belief Propagation to infer different probabilities, (marginal) distributions and values of variables for general factor graphs with categorical random variables as described in the slides on Graphical Models and Inference. More detailed information can be found in Chapter 8.4 in Christopher M. Bishop. 2006. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.

The preferred and easiest way of accomplishing this task is to complete this Jupyter Notebook, which already comes with a definition of the probabilistic model that you will work with. If you do not have any experience with Jupyter Notebook, the easiest way to start is to install Anaconda3, run Jupyter Notebook and open this notebook downloaded from BAYa_Assignment2021.ipynb.
